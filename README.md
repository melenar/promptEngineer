# promptEngineer

I recently had the privilege of attending a remarkable 8-hour workshop on Prompt Engineering and ChatGPT. Led by Mr. Vimal Daga at LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd, the session was a truly enlightening experience. I gained valuable insights into optimizing the performance of AI models like ChatGPT by employing effective prompt engineering techniques. The workshop pushed me to explore the intricacies of generating high-quality responses and equipped me with practical skills that I can readily apply in my professional endeavors.

Here's a summary of process:

-I expressed my interest in brainstorming real use case-based applications for an industry project that contributes to a community cause.

- ChatGPT and I discussed various ideas and settled on building a Food Waste Reduction App that addresses excess food from establishments as well as food wasted in home parties.

- The app aims to connect donors with local food banks or charities to minimize food waste and help those in need.

- ChatGPT outlined key features such as a food donation marketplace, inventory management, volunteer coordination, and education about food waste reduction.

- I requested assistance with the front-end development, and it provided an example HTML structure for the website layout.

- Additionally, it suggested CSS styles for basic visual enhancements and JavaScript code for form validation and dynamic search functionality.

- I then shifted the focus to the back-end development and proposed a step-by-step Java implementation for the core functionality of the Food Waste Reduction App.

- The back-end code included classes such as `FoodWasteReductionApp` to handle donations and search for available food, as well as the `FoodItem` class to represent individual donated food items.

- I emphasized the need to expand and customize the code based on your specific requirements, integrate it with a web framework, and handle HTTP requests and responses for a fully functional back-end.
